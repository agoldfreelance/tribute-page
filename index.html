     <h2>Humanity has Bean Enlightened</h2>
     <p>Long ago, the world was shrouded in baked-beanless sorrow. The arrival of the navy
       bean in Europe during the mid-16th century put an end to this as variations on the slow-baked dish
       of pale beans bubbling in a sweet and savory sauce developed throughout multiple regions. The richness
       of the bean, the tang of the sauce, the thick chunks of bacon hiding in the bowl, waiting to be discovered...
       the baked bean was always fated to quietly reign as a superior side dish. Although now mostly relegated to reside in tins at
       the supermarket or as a (depressingly) sporadically-available side at Finger Lickin' Chicken, the protein-packed bean dish is
       secure in its innate, though sometimes flatulent, deliciousness.</p>
